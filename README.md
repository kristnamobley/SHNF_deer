Python Project:
Sam Houston National Forest Deer Data Analysis using google colab

My husband collected data from a trail camera in the Sam Houston National Forest Fall of 2022. I used this data to determine conclusions and recommendations for fall 2023 hunting season.

1. I cleaned the data in google sheets. There was missing data and the date/time needed to be adjusted to hourly intervals to see when the most popular times were in the time period.  2. I then uploaded the data into google colab and imported necessary libraries.
3. I used EDA to explore the data and determine what variables have commonalities through Univariate and Bivariate analysis. I created data visualizations to gain insights and see patterns in the data.
4. I made Conclusions and Recommondations based on data insights from EDA and data visualizations.
