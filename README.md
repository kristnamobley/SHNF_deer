Python Project:
Sam Houston National Forest Deer Data Analysis using google colab

My husband collected data from a trail camera in the Sam Houston National Forest Fall of 2022. I used this data to determine conclusions and recommendations for fall 2023 hunting season.

1. I uploaded the data into google colab and imported necessary libraries.
2. I looked at the data and got information from Exploratory Data Analysis
3. I made Conclusions and Recommondations based on data from EDA.
